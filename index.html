							<h2>Who am I?</h2>
							<p>
								I am Rodger van der Heijden, an adventurous Dutch data scientist with a pragmatic
								approach to life. The past years I've devoted a lot of time in ensuring that I not only
								possess the necessary theoretical knowledge, but also the experience in dealing with
								issues only present in the 'dirty' real world. With a background in psychology and
								statistics, I am very well aware of the fact that results always are context-dependent,
								how people often make irrational decisions and how to deal with biases. I believe that
								communicating your findings and providing actionable recommendations or services is
								just as important as, if not more important than, the data science work involved in
								arriving there, which is why I've placed a lot of importance on creating understandable
								slidedecks and dashboards and actually putting my services in production.

							<h2>What excites me?</h2>
							<p>
								Though my parents may not believe it, I do actually also spend a lot of time away from
								my computer! In my time off I enjoy learning languages, with Polish and German
								currently on my list. Eventhough I've finished 4 marathons (and am thinking about when
								to start preparing my next one), my sporting heart lies with ice hockey, which I plan
								to pick up again soon. Having kept about 100 plants alive simultaneously I can
								confidently state that I also like gardening, but I'll have to restart my collection in
								Vienna.

							<h2>Why Vienna?</h2>
							<p>
								Despite many friends and family members having asked me this the past months, I still
								haven't been able to give a concise answer. Honestly though, I'm not the only one drawn
								to Vienna, as its #1 ranking as most liveable city in the world shows. Additionally, an
								adventure where I can easily learn German? Being (relatively) close to beautiful nature
								in the Alps, wonderful coasts to the south and Polish cities like Katowice or Kraków
								of course all help as well.

							<h2>Rodger van der Heijden Consultancy</h2>
							<p>Data science has frequently been heralded as the gold of the 21st century. However,
								interpreting data incorrectly can lead to catastrofically wrong inferences. Many small
								and medium-sized enterprises are experts in their domain and wonder what impact a
								shift towards a more data-driven approach to decision-making can have, but lack the
								required expertise and the funds to hire a full-time data scientist.</p>
							<p>As a contractor I analyze data quality, investigate the potential value the available
								data can have, assess the limitations or drawbacks, consult on the required steps for
								full integration and formulate recommendations on moving forward.</p>

							<h2>Subversive crime in the Netherlands</h2>
							<p>Autorities in the Netherlands have witnessed a steady increase in subversive crime over
								the last decades. Because subversive crime does not manifest in the same ways as
								'regular' crime, law enforcement agencies have been unable to respond
								appropriately. When looking at the money involved that makes sense as well: organized
								crime syndicates are estimated to have a yearly revenue of €18.9 billion compared
								to the €5.9 billion of the police.</p>
							<p>However, the Dutch government is very well aware of the ever-increasing severity of the
								issue, and has been taking steps to address it. Apart from stimulating collaboration
								between the many involved parties, more attention has been paid to developing a more
								complete understanding of subversive crime, its causes and where it takes place. I was
								commissioned to investigate whether we can predict and explain the incidence of
								subversive crime.

										<h3>Chest X-rays: a case against deep learning?</h3>

											Research into using deep learning architectures in medical contexts has

											experts, I set out to verify (and improve) his findings. Clinical experts
											claim that some pathologies distinguished between in the landmark paper can
											only be separated by additional dossier knowledge, making the distinction

											fix the network I did not match the results of the original paper, though
											it's unsure whether that can be explained by the different approach or

										<h3>Skin cancer prevention</h3>
										<p>
											What happens when you check your skin and see a new spot developing? As the
											largest organ of our bodies, our skin has to endure a lot. Scrapes, itches,
											exposure to sun and chemicals or toxins can damage your skin. Many spots on
											your skin turn out to be benign, but how can you know in advance? In tandem
											with dermatologists I studied whether nonmedical questions could allow
											patients to diagnose the two most common precursors of skin cancer. With
											just 9 questions we achieved accuracy scores of over 90%, suggesting that
											such a tool can be used as first check (but should definitely not replace
											an experts' opinion!).
