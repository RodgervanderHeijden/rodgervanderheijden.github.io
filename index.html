							<h2>Who am I?</h2>
							<p>
								I am Rodger van der Heijden, an adventurous Dutch data scientist with a pragmatic
								approach to life. The past years I've devoted a lot of time in ensuring that I not only
								possess the necessary theoretical knowledge, but also the experience in dealing with
								issues only present in the 'dirty' real world. With a background in psychology and
								statistics, I am very well aware of the fact that results always are context-dependent,
								how people often make irrational decisions and how to deal with biases. I believe that
								communicating your findings and providing actionable recommendations or services is
								just as important as, if not more important than, the data science work involved in
								arriving there, which is why I've placed a lot of importance on creating understandable
								slidedecks and dashboards and making sure my services are actually put into production.

							<h2>What excites me?</h2>
							<p>
								Though my parents may not believe it, I do actually also spend a lot of time away from
								my computer! In my time off I enjoy learning languages, with Polish and German
								currently on my list. Eventhough I've finished 4 marathons (and am thinking about when
								to start preparing my next one), my sporting heart lies with ice hockey, which I plan
								to pick up again soon. Having kept about 100 plants alive simultaneously I can
								confidently state that I also like gardening, but I'll have to restart my collection in
								Vienna. I won't be alone in Vienna though, as I'll be looking to also bring over my
								aquarium housing 23 snails!

							<h2>Why Vienna?</h2>
							<p>
								Despite many friends and family members having asked me this the past months, I still
								haven't been able to give a concise answer. Honestly though, I'm not the only one drawn
								to Vienna, as its #1 ranking as most liveable city in the world shows. Furthermore, it
								would present an awesome adventure to me with the added benefit of being able to learn
								German. Of course, being (relatively) close to the beautiful nature of the Alps, the
								wonderful coasts to the south and Polish cities like Katowice or Kraków don't hurt
								either.

							<p>Autorities in the Netherlands have witnessed a steady increase in subversive crime over
								the last decades. Because subversive crime does not manifest in the same ways as
								'regular' crime, law enforcement agencies have been unable to respond
								appropriately. When looking at the money involved that makes sense as well: organized
								crime syndicates are estimated to have a yearly revenue of €18.9 billion compared
								to the €5.9 billion of the police.</p>
							<p>However, the Dutch government is very well aware of the ever-increasing severity of the
								issue, and has been taking steps to address it. Apart from stimulating collaboration
								between the many involved parties, more attention has been paid to developing a more
								complete understanding of subversive crime, its causes and where it takes place. I was
								commissioned to investigate whether we can predict and explain the incidence of
								subversive crime.

											What happens when you check your skin and see a new spot developing? As the

											with dermatologists I studied whether nonmedical questions could allow
											patients to diagnose the two most common precursors of skin cancer. With
											just 9 questions we achieved accuracy scores of over 90%, suggesting that
											such a tool can be used as first check (but should definitely not replace
											an experts' opinion!).
