							<h1>Subversive crime</h1>
							<p class="major">
								The Netherlands has for decades been a big player in the (international) drug market.
								With traditionally relatively liberal drug policies, a very good infrastructure and
								being well-connected to other parts of Europe, it is not hard to see why. Experts
								estimate that the drug trade spans a yearly revenue of â‚¬18,9 billion a year, dwarfing
								the yearly budgets of the law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, we start to see the
								cripping effects on society as a whole. Are we doomed?

							<h2>What is subversive crime?</h2>
							<p>
								Frankly, subversive crime can both be "nearly everything" and "almost nothing". Common
								examples include money laundering or production and/or distribution of drugs, but acts
								like (digital) harassment, tax evasion or matchfixing can also be considered subversive
								(but aren't necessarily so!). In fact, it's quite well-known that Pablo Escobar used to
								build houses, football fields and schools to stay in good graces with the (poor)
								people. On the other hand, a matiral dispute escalating into murder is not seen as
								subversive.
							</p>
							<p>
								A cynic could remark that it's impossible to fight something if its definition may
								include <i>providing housing, opportunities for sports and education</i> while it may
								exclude <i>murder</i>.

							<h2>My involvement</h2>
							<p>
								Formulating a succesfull integral approach to tackling subversive crime requires all
								parties to hold a common view on the problem. However, as the many subproblems affect
								many areas of society, just as many jurisdictions are involved. The RIEC aims to
								achieve that by intensifying collaboration between partners, by increasing the
								information position and by developing both preventative and restrictive interventions.
							</p>
							<p>
								During my (paid) internship at RIEC I looked into the spatial component: a research
								topic which has been extensively studies in the context of "regular" crimes. Can we
								find commonalities between the areas where subversive crime manifests itself, and can
								we explain why these areas are specifically prone to this type of crime?

							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>
								Presumably to no surprise, I'm not at liberty to discuss the findings in much detail.
								In a general sense however, I was able to develop models that approximated areas prone
								to crime in general and subversive crime specifically, showing that the physical
								surroundings do indeed play a role in incidence of subversive crime. The models also
								showed clear differences in the factors of 'ideal' areas for both types of crime,
								indicating that just the characteristics of an area can predict what type of crime is
								present. Furthermore, presence of subversive crime was shown to be partially
								explainable to the characteristics of neighbouring areas as well.
