Dear potential reader,

This is the repo that contains the code for my personal portfolio page. It is not intended to be read, but GitHub simply
requires a public repo. Work-in-progress so please sit patient - or contact me directly - if information seems to be
missing or the page is broken. Thank you in advance.

Best,
Rodger
